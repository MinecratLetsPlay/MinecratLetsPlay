Hello

Im Minecraft Lets Play

And you guessed it!
I Like playing Minecraft (especially Modpacks)

But i also like Programming!

I like writing Batch scripts and Programming C++

I wrote an Large Batch Script called Admin Tool in Batch what basicly has ALL cmd commands in Menues 
and also has an Login system (Cause some commands can be used for evil purposes) and i have some C++ Projects going... 
(My biggest at the moment is a Password Generator)

You can Contact me at Discord... There you can also Download some of my Projects! https://discord.com/invite/tssKYweM3h
